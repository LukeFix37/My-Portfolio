            The Spider Project is a virtual reality simulation that allows users to get over a fear of spiders. 
            The project was created by a team of students at High Point University. 
            The goal of the project is to create an immersive experience that allows users to gain exposure to their fear of spiders
            while helping them learn how to cope with it:

                This is a photo of our team at HPU Minds. We are a team of
                High Point University computer science and interdisciplinary students who are working 
                with Steve Wozniak (High Point University's Innovator In Residence) to design and 
                create exciting new projects. So far projects have included aspects such as computer 
                vision, artificial Intelligence, electrical and mechanical engineering. Working 
                alongside Computer Science faculty and with mentoring from the co-founder of Apple, 
                our team gains not only technical experience but also valuable life skills such as 
                effective communication, teamwork, and time management. 
                The Woz Project gives undergraduate students the opportunity to use the concepts 
                they learn in the classroom and apply them in an innovative, creative and 
                collaborative environment.

                This is a photo of our team listening to a lecture from Steve Wozniak.
                We are learning about his experiences as an engineer and how important the work we are 
                doing as a team really is. He also offered a lot of career advice and 
                shared a lot of good input

                Some parts of the project including soldering wires and connecting them to a skin sensor.
                This way we were able to work with arduino to code the sensor to detect how the user's skin
                reacts to the VR simulation.
